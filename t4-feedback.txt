Overall, good! I can see a lot of great stuff like the exceptions, the care
taken to modulate the response codes and small things like returning the
new balance when transfering. 

Some minor comments:
-Now that you're all pro's consider rewriting:

        List<String> userList = new ArrayList<>();
        userList = userDAO.findAllUsers();

as ...

        List<String> userList = userDAO.findAllUsers();



- Name this variable better:
@Valid @RequestBody Widget widget
